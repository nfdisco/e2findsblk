e2findsblk
==========

Search for ext2, ext3 and ext4 filesystems in raw devices.

This program scans a device and prints the offset of anything that resembles
an ext2 filesystem.

Its main purpose is to locate filesystems in situations when the device's
partition table is corrupted or unreadable but the filesystem itself is
still accessible.  In such sitations, the filesystem can be mounted by
passing an offset option to mount(8).
